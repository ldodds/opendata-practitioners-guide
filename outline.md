# Open Data Practitioners Guide

Planned outline for the book.

### Introduction
 
* The state of open data - a brief look at the state of the open data landscape, range and types of organisations involved, references to reviews of impact and influence 
* why write this book?
  * need for comprehensive set of practical guidance
  * often see the same questions being asked by organisations, points to a need for more reference material
  * lots of good resources out there (and we'll reference them) but want to create a cohesive review of the topic
* who is this book for?
  * outline the different people/roles who might be interested
* what the book won't cover
  * not going to dig into business models, review impact, etc
* how is this book organised?
* an open publication - review how people can get the book for free, improve on it, etc

### Three metaphors for open data

* Metaphors as a useful way to think about a topic
* "Data as the new oil" isn't particularly useful
* The open data elephant - different perspectives of open data
* Stone soup
* Data as Roads (with hat tip to JeniT)

## Section 1. Basic Questions about Data

Section 1 is a collection of short essays, each of which cover a different aspect of open data

Each essay will have:
* A key question being asked
* Discussion
* References and further reading
* At the end of each section, have a clear answer and then a prompt for the next section

### Q1: What is open data?
  
* Definitions of open data, what are the key elements?
* The open data commons, open data as public good
* Debunking tragedy of the commons
* Examples of sources of open data, governments, organisations, community, research

### Q2: What is the data spectrum?
* Review closed-shared-open
* Access and reuse is the most important aspect not size, etc
* Spectrum helps to clarify that open data isn't something new and distinct, its a continuation/refinement of existing practices
* Increasing level of access by others
* Data can flow both ways along the spectrum, see: big data
* An open data practitioner is someone that helps ensure that data is placed on the right part of the data spectrum.
* Moving along the spectrum may involve transformational change: anonymisation or aggregation (see later)
* Open data practice as a high watermark for data sharing, means and methods are more general. See also "inner sourcing"; TR paper on shareability


### Q3: What is a dataset?

* What is data?
* Review the different definitions of dataset across different communities
* Discuss reasons for not breaking up datasets into smaller chunks
* Present a working definition of dataset: "a collection of machine-readable information, collected & managed by a specific organisation or team, using a common set of data governance practices, serves a clear purpose." 
* It's an operational definition that helps place dataset in context of how it is collected and managed. This is defines a useful boundary that identifies the publisher, means of production, etc.

### Q4: How do we describe datasets?

* What does your dataset contain?
* Review metadata standards that help describe some of these elements
* Highlight role of this data in discovery (& untapped potential)
* Reference to later section on documentation

### Q5: How do we enable reuse of data?
* Overview of rights relating to data, largely to call out jurisdictional differences
* What are open data licences?
* Problems with non-open licences

### Q6: How do we manage risks around open data?
* Begin with existing post on how risks are handled
* Concerns about implied permission   
* Risks relating to lack of timeliness in onward dissemination (Met Office)

### Q7: How do we publish and discover data?
* What is a data portal?
* Ways to publish data: download, APIs, integrated with the web (Linked Data, schema.org)
* How do we integrate data with the web? "Web native data"
* Linked Data, 5 Star scheme, semantic web.
* Limitations of portals

### Q8: How and why do we attribute data?
* Discuss differences between citation and attribution
* Why is attribution important? Relate to credit in science, citation networks, analysis of domains; relate to dependency management in open source (risks, maintenance, conformance of licences)

### Q9: What does the open data ecosystem look like?
* Beyond publishers and consumers
* How might this vary across different communities?
* Illustrate some examples, with a few simple tangible and intangible flows

### Q10: What is data infrastructure?
* Definition of data infrastructure
* Examples of data infrastructure

## Section 2 - Building an open data practice

Section 2 provides more detailed guidance on specific processes and activities that relate to open data

Each chapter will:
* provide an overview of the topic and why its important
* give a checklist of things you can or should do
* provide pointers to further reading
