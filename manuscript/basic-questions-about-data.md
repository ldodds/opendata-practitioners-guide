# Section 1: Basic questions about open data

The next few chapters each pose a specific question relating to the practice of open data. The questions are largely based on issues that repeatedly surface during open data projects. Each chapter builds on the previous ones and together should serve as an introduction to all of the key concepts that underpin the practice of open data.

The focus on seemingly basic questions is deliberate. Depending on your background the answers to some of these questions may seem obvious. But, as if often the case with simple questions, attempting to answer them will often highlight a number of issues or further questions to consider.

Open data often brings together teams from across different disciplines, so building shared understanding is essential. As an open data practitioner the following essays are intended to help you answer these questions as they arise in your own projects.

Each chapter is organised in the same way:

* posing the question to be explored
* a discussion that explores potential answers to the question and any relevant issues
* a recommended answer or working definition which we will use throughout the book, and which you can tailor or adapt for your own purposes

References to further reading will be included wherever appropriate.
