# Three metaphors for open data

I love a good metaphor.

In their book "Metaphors We Live By" George Lakoff and Mark Johnson explore how metaphors are important to not just how we think about and perceive the world. Metaphors help us understand one idea or concept in terms of another. The right metaphor can help us understand a new idea by highlighting important characteristics. But the wrong metaphor can hide important characteristics, drawing attention away from important elements. A good metaphor is a great communication tool. 

Obviously though any metaphor or analogy can be taken too far. It's important to know when to let them go and, perhaps, use an alternate metaphor that might highlight new perspectives.

People use lots of metaphors when they talk about data. 

Perhaps the most common is the ideas that "data is the new oil". Businesses around the world have discovered that they are sitting on untapped reserves of data resources that, through the application of new technology, can now be used to create new products and services. 

A related metaphor is the idea that there is a gold rush around data. Companies are rushing to turn data into valuable insights and profits. Many of them hoping to be the first to find and extract value from key datasets, or make a claim to be the data platform for their industry.

While these metaphors might help explain the scale of investment that is going into new technologies, platforms and data science, they don't really tell us much about data or even the data revolution itself. They don't have a great deal of power to provide insights beyond the rush for profits.

Oil refining is an extractive industry. It involves taking a limited natural resource and refining it into other products and profits. But data isn't like oil. It can be consumed and reused endlessly, by different businesses and people at the same time. 

And we don't just find data sitting undiscovered in databases. Collecting and maintaining data requires effort. Companies don't just refine data, they create it. Sometimes with or without the help of their customers and communities.

I want this book to help open data practitioners understand the key concepts that define open data and the open data movement. So I thought I would begin by introducing some metaphors which I think provide some useful insights. 

We'll encounter a few other metaphors later the book. We'll explore the data spectrum, and view about open data as energy that drives an ecosystem. We'll also think about data as water, flowing through systems. 

But before we get into those I wanted to share three metaphors which I think highlight some useful aspects of the practice of open data.

## Data is like Roads

Data is like roads. Roads help us navigate to a destination. Data helps us navigate to a decision.

This metaphor was first proposed by Jeni Tennison, CEO of the Open Data Institute (ODI). It's intended to highlight that data is rapidly playing an important role in modern society and business. Roads help us travel to work, school and support a variety of business uses. Roads are infrastructure that are created and supported by society for the benefit of all its users. Open data, and especially open data published by government and the public sector, has similar characteristics. Like roads, [data is infrastructure](https://theodi.org/what-is-data-infrastructure).

Thinking of data as enabling infrastructure draws out some important aspects that are not evident in the oil or gold rush metaphors. For example:

* data, like all infrastructure, supports a community of users. They may use it differently, but its continued availability is important to them
* roads are available for anyone to use, for any purpose. You don't need explicit permission to use a road. Openly licensed data has the same properties
* infrastructure needs to be managed and maintained to preserve its utility

And, like any shared resource, data should perhaps be governed by "rules of the road" that help ensure that it is used fairly and responsibly. There is a growing body of best practices and norms around the use of data which we'll explore later in this book.

The roads analogy is also useful in another way. It can help us think through how that infrastructure should be made available both now, and in the future. In [a series of blog posts](http://theodi.org/blog/how-will-future-affect-data-infrastructure) Peter Wells has proposed three possible futures:

* **Open roads**: in this open future, data is made as open as possible, so that it can support the widest possible community
* **Toll roads**: rather than having free access to data, we may have to pay a toll or other fee in order to access it
* **Private roads**: data is kept closed and is only accessible to those that collect it, for their own purposes

Like today, the future data landscape is likely to be criss-crossed with a mixture of open, shared and closed roads. What's most important is understanding the relative mix. How easy will it be to navigate to a decision using data?

I find this metaphor a useful framing for thinking through those questions.

## Stone Soup

The tale of "[Stone Soup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Soup)" is one that you may have heard already. Like all folk tales there are a number of different variations of it. The version I prefer goes something like this:

A hungry traveller who comes to a village carrying nothing but an empty cooking pot. Initially, the villagers are unwilling to share their food with the traveller. So, the traveler fills their cooking pot with water from a nearby stream and sets it over a fire. The traveller then puts a large stone into the pot and sits down to wait. Curious, the villagers ask the traveller what they're doing. The traveler explains that they are making "stone soup" which will be a delicious meal. But they could do with a little bit of garnish to help improve the flavour. One villager offers a few carrots, which are then added to the pot. The story continues with more and more of the villagers choosing to contribute something extra to the pot. The story ends with the stone being removed from the pot and the whole village and the traveler enjoying a delicious meal.

The story has often been used as a metaphor for community action. It clearly illustrates how small contributions from a wide community can add up to something much greater. 

In some interpretations of the story the traveler is described as crafty, having tricked the villagers into giving up their food. But this overlooks the fact that everyone takes a share in the results. None of the villagers could have created the meal by themselves. The soup needed a little something from everyone in order to be finished.

I think the stone soup story works as a useful metaphor for "the commons": the growing collection of openly licensed data, music, video and books that are freely available for anyone to enjoy. The commons isn't the creation of a single community or a single organisation. It's being created out of small contributions from a diverse set of people and businesses.

The metaphor also highlights some useful aspects of the open data movement. For example:

* the movement requires a catalyst, the traveler, who can encourage and support a community in contributing to the creation of something that is of value to everyone.
* it's the mixture of different ingredients, or datasets, that creates the end result
* everyone has something to contribute, but they need help in seeing the value in what they have to contribute
* the cooking pot is the infrastructure within which the meal is created. We rely on that infrastructure to help us collaborate
* the first contributions to the pot, like the stone, may be the least valuable or least interesting, so we need some imagination and a sprinkling of vision to help us envison the end result

If I were to push the metaphor to breaking point I'd suggest that the water in the pot is a bit like open data licences: its what helps us freely mix together different ingredients. But that might be going a little too far.

As an open data practitioner, you are the catalyst for your community. Together we are building the open data commons. 

## The Blind Men and the Elephant

Like Stone Soup the parable of the [Blind Men and the Elephant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant) is one you've probably heard before. And like Stone Soup there are many different versions.

In the story six blind men are asked to describe an elephant by feeling different parts of its body. The man that feels the elephant's leg declares the elephant to be like a pillar. The man that feels its tale says it is like rope, whereas another believes it to be like a snake after touching its trunk.

In some versions of the story, the men are unable to agree on the nature of an elephant and end up fighting each defending their own conclusion. In other versions of the story a king, or other wise man, explains that all of the men are correct but they had each only touched a part of the animal.

The story is used as a metaphor to illustrate the importance of understanding different viewpoints to fully understand a situation. Unlike the previous examples, this metaphor doesn't tell us much about the data revolution. But I think it does help to highlight something important about the open data movement.

The open data community is extremely broad. Members of the community have a variety of different types of expertise and are looking at how the practice of open data can solve problems in a number of different sectors.

For example open data is a key component of:

* the **open government** government
* the **open science** and **open access** community
* the **collaborative economy** 

Across these communities, many of the challenges that open data practitioners are facing are the same. I've encountered exactly the same debates around how best to publish open data in many different sectors. And usually the answers are exactly the same: create useful metadata, use open formats, and apply standard open licences.

But the reasons why different communities embrace open data, and the specific role it plays in those community may vary a great deal. 

For example there's a very strong overlap between open data and open government, particularly in the UK and US. This often results in us focusing on open data as a means to:

* encourage economic growth by creating new businesses and startups that are able to make better use of public sector resources
* create transparency so that we can better hold our public institutions to account
* help us solve social problems by enabling government to be more data-driven or explore how open innovation can help it work with civil society on specific challenges

But arguably the core reasons driving the adoption of open data in science are often different:

* sharing data can support reproducible research, allowing the quality of scientific research to improve
* highlighting the effort required to curate data allows those involved to receive proper credit for their activities, which the existing focus on publishing academic papers does not support
* collecting data can often be costly, or may not be repeatable for ethical reasons, so the ability to reuse data is important to support further research

Communities engaged in collaborative production of openly licensed databases like OpenStreetMap, Musicbrainz or Discogs do so because they are inspired by their individual interests and passions. Or perhaps because they believe that the world should have a free alternative to highly priced commercial datasets. In those areas, open licensing is the basis for developing trust and a sense of shared ownership in the results of their collective efforts.

I believe that as open data practitioners we must be mindful of these different perspectives as we create guidance or develop tools to support our community. These differences are particularly important when we attempt to assess the impact, progress and future development of open data programmes. Different sectors of the community will have their own definitions of success. 

It is not helpful to suggest, for example, that the only important open datasets are those that are regularly released via web APIs. I've seen this argument used to justify investment in APIs and data platforms to support application developers. While this might be useful to support use of open data in one sector or by one user community, it's not a general solution. For example, in contrast, the majority of datasets in the sciences are tiny datasets that will likely be analysed on the desktop. And they may never be updated after the completion of a specific research project. But these datasets have an important role in both the commons and the scientific record. Where there are differences are in the types of reuse they enable.

As practitioners it is important for us to see the whole elephant. To understand these different perspectives. They provide opportunities for us to learn from one another and, where useful, transfer best practices between communities.

In this book I will be trying to provide guidance that is applicable to the broader open data community. 

Let's get started.
