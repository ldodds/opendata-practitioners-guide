# Introduction

Welcome to The Open Data Practitioner's Guide.

An increasing variety of different organisations are starting to publish and reuse open data. There is a now a wealth of data that describes the places we live and our society. Around the world both governments and commercial organisations are using open data to drive transparency, solve social issues and create economic growth using a new generation of data-driven applications.

There is a growing body of evidence, use cases and research studies that shows how open data is starting have an impact in many different sectors of society, research and commerce.

I've spent more than 10 years participating in, supporting and leading a variety of different open data projects. In that time I've worked with a wide variety of startups, large multi-national organisations, public sector organisations and citizen-lead projects. Over time I've seen the same range of questions, issues and concerns beiing raised time and time again. Many organisations and open data practitioners are looking for help and support to develop their open data practice.

My goal in writing this book is to provide an accessible, comprehensive reference that will help answer these common questions. The book will also provide guidance for how to start building the processes that are part of a robust and sustainable open data practice.

## Who is this book for?

This book is intended to be a useful reference for anyone involved in supporting the publication of open data. This includes:

* __Open data leaders__ guiding the release of open data from local and central government
* __Data stewards__ responsible for overseeing the sharing and publication of data from within a variety of organisations
* __Developer evangelists__ supporting a community of developers using open data
* __Open data consultants__ looking for checklists and similar guidance to help support and develop their practice

Much of this book will focus on data publication as in my experience this is where many practitioners and organisations need support. The guide will include material which is relevant to data scientists and engineers using open data within their projects and product development. There is already a great deal of good technical documentation and references on data analysis.

However I would argue that regardless of whether you are a publisher or consumer of open data, it is important to have a common understanding of basic concepts and best practices. So there will hopefully be much of interest to anyone interested in open data.

## What this book doesn't cover

While this book is intended to be a comprehensive reference, it can't be all encompassing. There are a number of topics that won't be covered here:

* Case studies and impact assessments of open data projects - there is already a great deal of effort being spent on developing these types of resources
* How to build a business case for open data - my assumption is that you're either about to start your open data project or are already underway and want some help and guidance. 
* Data landscape reviews that examine the availability and adoption of open data in specific sectors - this book will include some guidance on mapping these kinds of ecosystems but won't focus on a specific sector

As this book is intended to be useful to a broad audience it will also be fairly high-level. While a number of technical topics will be introduced and discussed, no specific technology background will be assumed. This book is not a detailed reference on API design, Linked Data, or data modelling. 

## How is this book organised?

The guide has been divided into two sections. 

Section 1 consists of a background material covering key concepts, issues and questions that I've repeatedly encountered in my own open data work. Each chapter in Section 1 is a short essay covering a basic question relating to publishing data for reuse. The essays build on one another to introduce a number of important concepts. 

The topics covered include questions such as:

* What is a dataset?
* How do we describe datasets?
* How do we enable reuse of data?
* How do we publish and discover datasets?

Building on these foundations, Section 2 focuses on providing useful guidance that will help you develop your open data practice. Each of the chapters covers an individual process or activity that contributes toward the sustainable publication, release and use of open data. The topics covered include:

* How to document datasets to enable reuse
* How to engage with and support reusers of your data
* How to build a data release process that includes the appropriate oversight required to ensure data is published in an accessible, risk free way

Section 2 wiill also introduce a number of tools that will help benchmark your organisations open data practice. These include the open data maturity model and the open data certificates.

As each chapter will focus on a specific question or process they should act as individual references that can be referred to as and when you need the advice. Checklists and references for further reading will help guide your thinking and provide jumping off pointers for further research.
