# Introduction

Welcome to The Open Data Practitioner's Guide!

An increasing variety of organisations are starting to publish and reuse open data. And there is now a wealth of data that describes the places we live and the workings of our society. Around the world both governments and commercial organisations are using open data to drive transparency, address social issues and create economic growth using a new generation of data-driven applications.

There is a growing body of evidence, use cases and research studies that shows how open data is having an impact in many different sectors of society, research and commerce.

I've spent more than 10 years participating in, supporting and leading a variety of different open data projects. I've worked with a wide variety of startups, multi-national and public sector organisations as well as citizen-lead projects. Over that time I've repeatedly seen the same range of questions, issues and concerns being raised. Many organisations and open data practitioners are looking for help and support to develop their open data practice.

My goal in writing this book is to provide an accessible, comprehensive reference that will help answer these common questions. The book will also hopefully provide useful guidance for how to begin building the processes that are part of a robust and sustainable open data practice.

## Who is this book for?

This book is intended to be a useful reference for anyone involved in supporting the publication and use of open data. This includes:

* __open data leaders__ guiding the release of open data from local and central government
* __data stewards__ responsible for overseeing the sharing and publication of data from within a variety of organisations and collaborative project
* __developer evangelists__ supporting a community of developers using open data
* __open data consultants__ looking for checklists and similar guidance to help support and develop their practice

Much of this book will focus on data publication. In my experience this is where many practitioners and organisations need support. But the guide will also covers topics relevant to data scientists and engineers using open data in their projects. 

But I would argue that regardless of whether you are a publisher or consumer of open data, it is important to have a thorough understanding of the basic concepts and best practices. With this in mind, the guide should also contain much of interest to anyone interested in open data more broadly.

## What this book doesn't cover

While this book is intended to be a comprehensive reference, it can't cover every topic. There are a number of areas that won't be covered here:

* case studies and impact assessments of open data projects - there is already a number of great resources creating these types of resources
* how to build a business case for open data - my assumption is that you're either about to start your open data project or are already underway and are looking for some help and guidance 
* data landscape reviews exploring the availability and adoption of open data in specific sectors - while the guide will include some recommendations for mapping these ecosystems, it won't focus on a specific sector

As the guide is intended to be useful to a broad audience it will also be fairly high-level. A number of technical topics will be introduced and discussed, but no specific technology background will be assumed. This book is not a detailed reference on API design, Linked Data, or data modelling. 

## How is this book organised?

The guide has been divided into two sections. 

Section 1 consists of background material covering key concepts, issues and questions that I've repeatedly encountered in my own open data practice. Every chapter in Section 1 is a short essay exploring a basic question relating to data publication. The essays build upon one another to cover a number of important concepts. 

The questions that will be explored include:

* What is a dataset?
* How do we describe datasets?
* How do we enable reuse of data?
* How do we publish and discover datasets?

Building on these foundations, Section 2 focuses on providing useful guidance that will help you develop your open data practice. Each chapters covers an individual process or activity that contributes toward the sustainable publication, release and use of open data. 

The topics covered include:

* How to document datasets to enable reuse
* How to engage with and support re-users of your data
* How to build a data release process that includes the appropriate oversight required to ensure data is published in an accessible, risk free way

Section 2 will also introduce a number of tools that will help benchmark your open data practice.

As individual chapters will focus on a specific question or process they should act as useful references for when you need advice on specific topics. Checklists and references for further reading will be provided to help guide your thinking and indicate jumping off points for further research.
