So what is open data anyway?

# What is open data?

Open data is data that anyone can access, use and share. 

This is the Open Data Institute (ODI) definition of open data. It was intended to provide a simple dictionary definition of the concept of open data that is useful for a wide audience. An elevator pitch that condenses the idea into a single sentence.

The definition works very well. It fits in a tweet and fits well on a slide in a presentation. But I always immediately unpack the statement to provide a bit more context.

By _access_ what we mean is that the data is available online in some form. You can point to it, download it, or query it in some way. We'll explore the ways in which data can be usefully published in Section 1.

By _use_ we mean that the data isn't simply presented in a form that allows it to be read, e.g. in a document, but is published in a way that it can be re-purposed or analysed. Reading is just one form of use. This means that data is presented in a machine-readable form that is more amenable to manipulation.

And by _share_ we mean that open data lets us do more than just use data. After it has been corrected, transformed, enriched or aggregated it can then be re-published for others to use. This requires that data be published under an open licence that gives us permission to do all of those things. In Section 1 we will look more closely at how open licences are the cornerstone of the open data movement.

But what do we mean by allowing _anyone_ to do that? While there's a whole discussion to be had around who we are enabling with the sharing of open data (see Section 1) the important aspect to draw out first is that anyone means citizens, individuals, developers, researchers and commercial organisations. Open licences do not place restrictions around who is accessing, using and sharing data.

While the ODI definition provides a useful jumping off point for these discussions, it glosses over a number of important aspects. For example data can be made machine-readble in many different ways, some of which are not easy to reuse without paying for specific software or services. For a more complete specification of open data we can turn to the Open Definition.

Created by the Open Knowledge Foundation (OKF) and managed by an expert advisory council, the definition is intended to be the touchstone that defines the basic principles of what is means to share data in licences and using formats and methods that are as open data possible.

The Open Definition highlights the importance of:

* publishing data using open formats that can be used without needing proprietary software
* making data available for free, so it can be used by the widest possible audience
* ensuring that data can be easily accessed and shared without requiring onerous sign-up processes or specific technical platforms or processes

The Open Definition is based on a similar definition which has helped foster the growth of open source software. 

This connection is important as it highlights that open data is just a part of a broader movement.

# "All of the open"

The principles of opennness, sharing and collaboration have been having an impact in a number of disciplines and sectors for some years. Open data is perhaps best viewed as a natural progression that includes:

* Open source - the collaborative creation and maintenance of free software
* Open content - the publication of openly licensed, free content in the form of text, images, movies and music
* Open access - applying open licences to the outputs of academic research to enable it to benefit a wider audience of researchers

The common elements to all of these include:

* sharing of outputs under open licences to enable use by the widest possible audience
* remixing and repurposing of content to create new works, products or solve new challenges
* collaborative production
* collaborative maintenance

These have all been enabled by the web as it provides a common environment to support the publication and sharing of openly licensed materials, and the collaboration tools that enable communities around the world to come together to tackle problems. Open data is a key raw material in this process. As is the open source software used to manipulate it.

Collectively this type of collaborative action can be referred to as "open innovation".

However I see "open innovation" as just one activity that benefits from The Commons. 

The Commons consists of the wealth of openly licensed content, software and data that we are creating as a society. Open innovation is a means of using that to solve a variety of local and global challenges by enabling better collaboration between a variety of organisations. 

But the Commons itself is sustained by a number of other important activities that we must not overlook: 

* the activities of creators willing to openly license their creations
* the role of archivists in ensuring that these outputs remain available over the long-term
* the creation of collaboration tools that support co-production
* ...TODO..
